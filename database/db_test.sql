In this paper, we study SPS for ARX systems,and establish that the conﬁdence regions are guaranteed to include the true model parameterwith exact, user-chosen, probability under mild statistical assumptions, a property that holdstrue for any ﬁnite number of observed input-output data. Furthermore, we prove the strongconsistency of the method, that is, as the number of data points increases, the conﬁdence regiongets smaller and smaller and will asymptotically almost surely exclude any parameter valuediﬀerent from the true one. In addition, we also show that, asymptotically, the SPS regionis included in an ellipsoid which is marginally larger than the conﬁdence ellipsoid obtainedfrom the asymptotic theory of system identiﬁcation.

Standardsolutions such as the method of least squares (LS) or, more generally, prediction error methodsIn many situations (for example when the safety, stability or qualityprovide point estimates.of a process has to be guaranteed), a point estimate needs to be complemented by a conﬁdenceregion that certiﬁes the accuracy of the estimate and serves as a basis for ensuring robustness. Ifthe noise is known to belong to a given bounded set, set membership approaches can be used tocompute the region of the parameter values that are consistent with the observed data, see e.g.,[39, 41, 32, 40, 46, 12, 29]. The need for deterministic priors on the noise can be relaxed by workingin a probabilistic framework, see e.g., [27, 16]. However, traditional methods for construction ofconﬁdence regions in a probabilistic setting rely on approximations based on asymptotic results andare valid only if the number of observed data tends to inﬁnity, see e.g., [37]. In spite of the well-known fact that evaluating ﬁnite-sample estimates based on asymtptic results can lead to misleadingconclusions [22], the study of the ﬁnite-sample properties of system identiﬁcation algorithms hasremained a niche research topic until recent times.In this regard, a notable (and now-expanding) literature has investigated the connection betweencertain characteristics of the system model at hand and the rates at which the system parameterscan be learnt from data. Seminal works in this line, which addressed in particular the learning ofﬁnite impulse response (FIR) and autoregressive exogenous (ARX) models, are [67, 23, 68, 65, 59];nowadays, several ﬁnite-sample studies for various classes of linear [43, 49, 28, 42, 54, 55, 47, 51] andnonlinear [60, 21, 48, 38] systems are available, also in connection to relevant control frameworks,[1, 6, 18, 20], see [56] for a recent survey and more references. While conﬁdence regions for theunknown parameters are easily obtained as valuable side products of the investigations mentionedabove, these regions are typically conservative as they have rigid shapes, parametrised by someknown characteristics of the system or of the noise, and their validity relies on uniform bounds. Onthe other hand, the goal of producing nonconservative conﬁdence regions by exploiting the observeddataset along more ﬂexible approaches was pursued by another, complementary research eﬀort, aproduct of which is the Sign-Perturbed Sums (SPS) algorithm, which forms the subject of this paper.SPS was introduced in [13] with the aim of constructing ﬁnite-sample regions that include theunknown parameter with an exact, user-chosen probability in a quasi distribution-free set-up. Thereader is referred to [11] for a discussion on the mutual relation between SPS and other ﬁnite-samplemethods, such as the bootstrap-style Perturbed Dataset Methods of [34] and the Leave-Out Sign-Dominant Correlation Regions (LSCR) method, a (more conservative) predecessor of SPS that wasintroduced in [9] and then extended to quite general classes of systems, and applied in a variety of2contexts, see e.g., [17, 25, 2, 26].SPS was studied from a computational point of view in [33] and extended to a distributedset-up in [69]. Applications of SPS can be found in several domains, ranging from mechanicalengineering [62, 63] and technical physics [19, 24, 61], to wireless sensor networks [8] and socialsciences [53]. Moreover, the SPS idea constitutes a core technology of several recent algorithms,including techniques for state estimation [44], for the identiﬁcation of state-space systems [3, 52],error-in-variables systems [30, 31], and for kernel-based estimation [15, 4].From the strictly theoretical point of view, SPS was studied in [14] for linear regression modelswhere the regressors are independent of the noise, which is, in particular, the case for open-loop FIRsystems. In that setting, it was shown that SPS provides exact conﬁdence regions for the parametervector and it guarantees the inclusion of the least-squares estimate (LSE) in the conﬁdence region.The main assumptions on the noise in [14] are that it forms an independent sequence and that itsdistribution is symmetric about zero; however, the distribution is otherwise unknown and it canchange, even in each time-step.At the beginning of this paper, we extend the SPS method to autoregressive exogenous (ARX)systems and show that it has the same ﬁnite-sample properties as SPS for FIR systems. In therest of the paper, we develop an asymptotic analysis of the extended SPS method. Although thecharacterising property of SPS is that of providing exact, ﬁnite-sample guarantees, its asymptoticproperties are also of interest because they shed light on the capability of SPS to exploit the in-formation carried by a growing amount of data. For example, they play a role in the importantproblem of detecting model misspeciﬁcations, see [10]. The asymptotic analysis of the SPS algo-rithm of [14] was carried out in [66], but that analysis does not apply to the ARX case becauseof the existing correlation between the regressor vector and the system output. In this paper weshow that also SPS for ARX systems is strongly consistent, in the sense that the conﬁdence regionshrinks around the true parameter and, asymptotically, all parameter values diﬀerent from the trueone will be excluded. Moreover, the asymptotic size and shape of the SPS conﬁdence region isshown to be included in a marginally inﬂated version of the conﬁdence ellipsoids obtained usingasymptotic system identiﬁcation theory.Structure of the paperThe paper is organized as follows. In the next section we introduce the problem setting and recallthe least-squares estimate for ARX models. Then, in Section 3, the SPS method for ARX systems ispresented along with its fundamental ﬁnite-sample properties (Theorem 1). The asymptotic resultsare provided in Section 5 (Theorems 2 and 3). A simulation example illustrating the theoreticalproperties is given in Section 6, and conclusions are drawn in Section 7. The proofs of the theorems3are all postponed to Appendices.A preliminary version of the SPS algorithm for ARX systems was presented in [13], where atheorem on its ﬁnite-sample guarantees was proven under slightly stronger assumptions than thoseof Theorem 1 in this paper. The Strong Consistency Theorem (Theorem 2) and the AsymptoticShape Theorem (Theorem 3) are stated and proven in this paper for the ﬁrst time.2 Problem Setting2.1 Data generating system and problem formulationThe data generating ARX system is given byYt + a∗1Yt−1 +a∗naYt−na = b∗1Ut−1 +b∗nbUt−nb + Nt,· · ·· · ·(1)R is the output, Ut ∈where Yt ∈written in linear regression form asR the input and Nt ∈R the noise at time t.

Therefore, the distribution of H0(θ∗) is diﬀerentfrom that of Hi(θ∗), i = 1, . . . , m1. A key idea in the SPS algorithm for ARX systems is to generateregressors, denoted ¯ϕi,t(θ), such thathave the same distribution. Theelements of ¯ϕi,t(θ) include, instead of the observed outputs, the outputs of the system correspondingto the parameter θ fed with the perturbed noise. Thus, the perturbed output sequence¯Yi,1(θ), . . . , ¯Yi,n(θ) is generated for every θ = [ a1, . . . , ana, b1, . . . , bnb ]T according to equationαi,t ¯ϕi,t(θ∗)Nt}ϕtNt}αi,tNt(θ)Nt}and−{{{{{}¯Yi,t(θ) + a1 ¯Yi,t−1(θ) +· · ·ana¯Yi,t−na(θ) , b1Ut−1 +bnbUt−· · ·nb + αi,t ˆNt(θ),(10)where ˆNt(θ) is given by (6), and the initial conditions for ¯Yi,t(θ) are ¯Yi,t(θ) , Yt for 1The re-generated regressor is then given asna ≤t−≤0.¯ϕi,t(θ) , [¯Yi,t−1(θ), . . . ,¯Yi,t−−na(θ), Ut−1, . . . , Ut−nb]T.(11)−Using this perturbed regressor, the analogue of functions H0(θ) and Hi(θ) deﬁned above can beconstructed, and we denote them S0(θ) and Si(θ) to avoid confusion. Moreover, for θ = θ∗, S0(θ∗)and Si(θ∗) have the same ordering property as H0(θ∗) and Hi(θ∗) for FIR systems.3.2.1 SPS for ARX systemsThe SPS method for ARX systems is now detailed in two distinct parts. The ﬁrst, which is called“initialisation”, sets the main global parameters of SPS and generates the random objects needed forthe construction. In the initialisation, the user provides the desired conﬁdence probability p. Thesecond part evaluates an indicator function which decides whether or not a particular parametervalue θ is included in the conﬁdence region.nnnThe pseudocode for the initialisation and the indicator function is given in Tables 1 and2, respectively. Note that in point 4 of Table 2, in the computation of S0(θ) and Si(θ), thevectors 1nαi,t ¯ϕi,t(θ) ˆNt(θ) have been premultiplied by the matrices R−nϕt ˆNt(θ) and 1n( 1nconﬁdence regions, as discussed in Section 5.3. The permutation π in point 3 in the initialisation2 or(Table 1) is only used in the indicator function (Table 2) to decide which function2 take on the same value. More precisely, given m2 .

The following theorem holds.{θ∗= 1Theorem 1. Under Assumptions 1 and 2, the conﬁdence region constructed by the SPS algorithmin Table 1 and 2 has the property that PrΘn}bThe proof of Theorem 1 can be found in Appendix A.1. The simulation examples in Section 6also demonstrate that, when the noise is stationary, the SPS conﬁdence regions compare in size withthe heuristic conﬁdence regions obtained by applying the asymptotic system identiﬁcation theory.However, unlike the asymptotic regions, the SPS regions are theoretically guaranteed for any ﬁniten, and also maintain their guaranteed validity with nonstationary noise patterns.qm−∈5 Asymptotic ResultsIn addition to the probability of containing the true parameter, another important aspect is thesize and the shape of the SPS conﬁdence regions.In this section, under some additional mildassumptions, we prove i) a Strong Consistency theorem which guarantees that the SPS conﬁdencesets get smaller and smaller as the number of data points gets larger, and ii) an Asymptotic ShapeTheorem stating that, as both n and m tend to inﬁnity, the conﬁdence sets are included in amarginally inﬂated version of those produced by the asymptotic system identiﬁcation theory.These two theorems will be proved under the basic Assumptions 1 and 2, plus some assumptionsthat are now introduced and discussed. We ﬁrst discuss the common identiﬁability assumptionsunder which both the strong consistency and the asymptotic shape results are proven. Then, weisolate and discuss an additional simplifying assumption that is only used to prove the asymptoticshape theorem.5.1 AssumptionsLet us deﬁne A(z−the delay operator.

The polynomials A(z−1; θ∗), B(z−1; θ∗) are coprime.The set of values of θ that are allowed to be included in the conﬁdence region is normally limitedby a priori knowledge on the system and, in general, it will be a proper subset of Rd. Althoughoccasionally it can be left implicit, in this paper the subset of values of θ will be denoted by Θc andalways assumed to be a compact set.Assumption 4 (uniform-stability). The families of ﬁltersare uniformly stable.{1A(z−1;θ) : θΘc}∈and{B(z−1;θ)A(z−1;θ) : θΘc}∈We brieﬂy recall the deﬁnition of uniform stability, see [37] for details. First,A(z−1;θ) andΘc.

Before we present our results, theconﬁdence ellipsoids based on the asymptotic system identiﬁcation theory are brieﬂy reviewed, seee.g., [37] for a more detailed presentation.5.3.1 Conﬁdence ellipsoids based on the asymptotic system identiﬁcation theory{Nt}zero mean and i.i.d., and under some other technical assumptions, √n (ˆθn −θ∗) can beForproved to converge in distribution to the Gaussian distribution with zero mean and covarianceσ2 (ˆθn −, where σ2 is the variance of Nt, and ¯Rmatrix σ2 ¯R−∗∗(ˆθn−θ∗)T ¯Rθ∗) converges in distribution to the χ2 distribution with dim(θ∗) = d degrees of freedom.∗This result was derived under uniform stability and input boundedness conditions in [37, Chapters8-9].Rn.

Although from a bird’s eye point of view the proof followsthe same line as the proof in [66], from a technical point of view a crucial diﬀerence is that, while in1, were all quadratic functions, in the present[66] functionsk1, are ratios of polynomials whose orders increase linearlysetting functionswith n, so that the uniform evaluation of these functions over θ as nrequires much moreattention. Nevertheless, results similar to those in [66] can be obtained by exploiting i) the linearityof the system, ii) the continuity (to be deﬁned in a suitable sense, and proven to hold) of the¯Yi,t(θ)with respect to small variations of θ, and iii) Theorem 2, which guarantees that,sequenceas n grows, the eﬀects ofhave to be evaluated in a smaller and smaller neighbourhoodof θ∗. Another caveat is that independence conditions that were satisﬁed in the FIR case are lostin the ARX case. Nonetheless, similar results can be proven thanks to random sign-perturbations,which play a crucial role in making theorems on martingales applicable to our setting.¯Yi,t(θ)→ ∞}{}{146 Numerical ExampleConsider the following simple data generating systemYt =a∗Yt1 + b∗Ut−1 + Nt,−−with zero initial conditions. a∗ =is asequence of i.i.d.

In Figure 3, m is also increased to 4000, and one can observe that there is very littlediﬀerence between the SPS region and the asymptotic conﬁdence ellipsoid demonstrating the resultestablished in Theorem 3.7 Concluding Remarks and Open ProblemsIn this paper, we have presented the SPS method for ARX systems. SPS delivers conﬁdence regionsaround the least-squares estimate that contain with exact, user-chosen, probability the true systemparameter under mild assumptions on the data generation mechanism. These regions are builtfrom a ﬁnite (and possibly small) sample of input-output data. Besides the exact ﬁnite-sampleguarantees, we have proven under additional and rather mild assumptions that the method isstrongly consistent and that the conﬁdence regions are included in a slightly enlarged version of theapproximate conﬁdence ellipsoids obtained using the asymptotic theory.Finally, we want to mention an important further direction of research. While the SPS regionshave many desirable features, the exact calculation of the regions is computationally demanding. ForFIR systems, an eﬀective ellipsoidal outer approximation of the conﬁdence regions can be practicallycomputed by using convex programming techniques ([14], see also [33]). Obtaining similar resultsfor ARX system is an ongoing challenge of great practical importance. On the other hand, the SPSalgorithm presented in this paper lends itself nicely to problems where the indicator function has tobe evaluated for a ﬁnite, moderate set of values of θ, which is the case in certain change detectionor hypothesis testing problems. Moreover, when the dimension of the parameter vector θ is small,the SPS region can be computed by checking whether points on a ﬁne grid of the parameter spacebelong to the conﬁdence set.A ProofsA.1 Proof of Theorem 1: exact conﬁdenceWe begin with a deﬁnition and two lemmas taken from [14].17Deﬁnition 1.

The second step is proving the uniform convergence of ˆθi,n(θ) to θ.3 Todo this, we ﬁrst prove that Ri,n(θ), i = 1, . . . , m1, converge uniformly in Θc to a matrix function−¯R(θ) that is positive deﬁnite, with eigenvalues that are uniformly bounded away from 0 and from.∞Second, we show that the right hand side of (18) goes to zero uniformly in Θc with probability 1.4t (as deﬁned in Table 2). First, wekϕtϕTt=1PkS0(θ)kn(20)2In the terminology of [34] this is the minimiser of the cost function corresponding to the “perturbed dataset”.3This requires some caution because ¯Yi,1(θ), . . . , ¯Yi,n(θ) is the output of the non-standard system (10), where Utaﬀects future noise terms through ˆNt+1(θ), ˆNt+2(θ), . . ., and the expected value of ˆN 2t+1(θ) given the past is notuniformly bounded. Thus, traditional consistency results such as those in [36], although quite general and inclusiveof closed-loop set-ups, do not apply to this setting.4This step is carried out by using martingale arguments that are inspired by the proof in [36], together with asuitable “conditioning trick”.19Combining these two facts, we will conclude that ˆθi,n(θ) converges to θ, andThis implies that, for n large enough,the values of θthe conﬁdence region.0 uniformly.2 for allΘc outside a small ball centred at θ∗, so that such values of θ are excluded fromk1 are smaller than2, i = 1, . . . , m→S0(θ)kSi(θ)Si(θ)−∈kkkk2A.2.2 ProofThe following two lemmas are the key results to prove the theorem.

IntroductionThe construction of mathematical models to describe growth dynamics hasbeen the subject of several studies in the last decades. The reason is the varietyof situations where these phenomena arise in a natural way. Originally, studiesfocused on population growth, although nowadays they extend to many otherresearch fields. For instance, in recent years, these models have been applied totumor growth and the spread of diseases.One of the main problems associated with the study of growth phenomenais the choice of a suitable model: even though diverse representations by de-terministic models based on sigmoidal curves have been used (Tsoularis andWallace (2002)), the presence of fixed inflection points restricts the adequacy ofthe model to real circumstances.In order to deal with these issues, the hyperbolastic curves of type I, II andIII (H1, H2 and H3, respectively), were developed by Tabatabai et al. (2005),∗Corresponding authorEmail addresses: antonio.barrera@uma.es (Antonio Barrera), proman@ugr.es (PatriciaRom´an-Rom´an), fdeasis@ugr.es (Francisco Torres-Ruiz)Preprint submitted to BioSystems      who introduced hyperbolic functions into known models, thus obtaining mobileinflection points and increasing the capability of the models to fit real data.Recent results have proved the usefulness of these curves in the descriptionand modeling of dynamical phenomena. In this sense, Eby et al. (2010) usedhyperbolastic models to study the growth of the solid Ehrlich carcinoma un-der particular treatments, obtaining a more accurate representation than thoseyielded by other classic curves such as Gompertz or Weibull. Tabatabai et al.(2011) used the H3 model to describe the behavior of embryonic stem cells, im-proving the results of other models such as those in Deasy et al. (2003). Recently,new models also derived from hyperbolastic curves have been introduced, suchas the oscillabolastic model (Tabatabai et al. (2012)) or the T-model (Tabatabaiet al. (2013)).Despite the good results obtained by applying these deterministic models,it is clear that natural dynamical phenomena occur under the influence of un-known (or even immeasurable) factors which can have a significant effect onthe evolution of the process. Therefore, introducing into the models certainelements capable of describing such influences seems necessary and justified. Inthis way, the next step in the mathematical modeling of dynamic phenomenalies in extending deterministic models to stochastic models while taking intoaccount the random influences affecting the dynamics of the phenomenon.To this end, stochastic processes, and in particular diffusion processes, ap-pear as the most appropriate tool. In the context of growth curves, these pro-cesses arise when a random factor is introduced into the differential equationwhose solution is the aforementioned curve, thus becoming a stochastic differ-ential equation whose solution is the final process.This methodology, used by Capocelli and Ricciardi (1974) for obtaining adiffusion process associated with the Gompertz curve, has been applied to awide range of curves. A modification of such model has been recently appliedto tumor growth by Albano et al. (2011, 2013). Diffusion processes based onthe Bertalanffy curve have been applied to the study of population growth inanimals and plants (Rom´an-Rom´an et al. (2010); Rom´an-Rom´an and Torres-Ruiz (2014); Russo et al. (2009)). With respect to the logistic curve, for whichthe first model was proposed by Feller (1940), Kolmogorov equations have noexplicit solution, so the transition probability density function is not known inclosed-form. Therefore, many variants have been proposed, for which a sum-mary can be consulted in Tuckwell and Koziol (1987). Schurz (2007) considereda more general version of the stochastic differential equation associated withlogistic growth and Barrera-Garc´ıa et al. (2013) proposed a Gaussian logisticdiffusion process, whereas Rom´an-Rom´an et al. (2012) established a diffusionprocess based on a reformulation of the logistic curve. Recently, Rom´an-Rom´anand Torres-Ruiz (2015) generalized this last diffusion process to the case of theRichards curve.In this paper we introduce a diffusion process whose mean function is a re-formulation of the H1 curve. This allows us to express the asymptotic behavioraccording to the initial values. Thanks to this, we can consider situations wheredata are available from many individuals, each exhibiting the same growth pat-2tern but with different bounds for the initial value.In this way, we construct a model such that its mean function is an H1 curve,making it suitable for prediction purposes. To this end, data must be used toobtain estimates for the parameters of the process, an estimation that is carriedout by maximum likelihood. This is not problematic as far the parameters ofthe initial distribution are concerned, but the estimation of the rest of param-eters yields a system of equations whose solution is not guaranteed by classicalnumerical procedures. An alternative is the use of metaheuristic optimizationprocedures, to which purpose we propose using the firefly algorithm (FA). In-troduced by Yang (2008), this population-based, nature-inspired metaheuristicalgorithm is undergoing an important development in fields such as engineeringand optimization (e.g. the works of Alb et al. (2016) and Kavousi-Fard et al.(2014) for its efficiency and capacity to deal with NP-hard problems). Someinteresting modifications have also been made (Gandomi et al. (2013); Zhanget al. (2016)). The low computational cost of the algorithm makes it especiallyuseful to address maximum likelihood estimation in diffusion processes.This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents a reformulation ofthe H1 curve, including some relevant properties. The scope of this work isrestricted to the case of increasing curves showing at least one inflection point.The hyperbolastic type-I diffusion process (from now on referred to as H1 diffu-sion process) is introduced as a particular case of the lognormal diffusion processwith exogenous factors. Section 3 deals with the estimation of the parametersof the model by means of the maximum likelihood procedure, showing the com-plexity of the system of equations. This question leads to our proposal of usingFA as a valid tool for maximizing the likelihood function. A summary of thealgorithm and its properties is then shown, as well as the modifications requiredin our context. In this sense, a procedure for bounding the parametric space isproposed. Finally, in Section 4, the methodology is applied to two examples:the first over simulated data, and the second over real data from a study abouta molecular biology technique called quantitative polymerase chain reaction.2. The model2.1. Reformulation of the H1 curveThe H1 curve is the solution of the Bernoulli differential equationdx(t)dt= M −1x(t)(cid:16)M − x(t)(cid:17) (cid:18)ρ +√(cid:19)θ1 + t2, t ≥ t0, θ ∈ R,(1)with initial value x(t0) = x0 > 0. Here, x(t) represents the size of a populationat time instant t and M denotes the maximum sustainable population (carryingcapacity), whereas parameters θ and ρ jointly determine growth rate. Note thatwhen θ = 0 this equation is the well-known logistic differential equation.The solution to (1) isx(t) = M (1 + a exp (−ρt − θ arcsinh(t)))−1 ,(2)3wherea = x−10 (M − x0) exp (ρt0 + θ arcsinh(t0)) .Note that limt→∞ x(t) = M if ρ > 0, and limt→∞ x(t) = 0 if ρ < 0. So, ifρ > 0, the curve increases to the asymptote M , whereas ρ < 0 leads to decayprofiles.In the above remark we have shown that the asymptote M is independentfrom the initial value, something that can become an important restriction forsome applications. In practice, there are situations in which the growth phe-nomenon under study shows an H1-type sigmoidal growth and several samplepaths are available, each with the same growth pattern but with different initialvalues and upper bounds (as the weight of individuals in a population). Forthese reasons, in order to model the situations in which the limit value dependson the initial one, we consider a reformulation of curve (2). Setting η = 1/a,λ = e−ρ, and µ = e−θ we obtainx(t) = x0η + ξ(t0)η + ξ(t), t ≥ t0, η, µ > 0,(3)where ξ(t) = λtµarcsinh (t). In the following we will deal with increasing curves.This question leads to conditions 0 < λ < 1 and µ < cλ(t), ∀t ≥ t0, where1+t2 is an increasing function for all t. Therefore, in the followingcλ(t) = λ−we will consider µ < cλ(t0).√Another important characteristic of the H1 curve is the mobility of its in-flections, which gives it a flexibility superior to that of other commonly usedcurves, allowing for more precise modeling of phenomena showing a sigmoidalbehavior. From x′′(t) = 0 it follows that inflections of the curve verify thefollowing equation, which corresponds, after the reparametrization made in thecurve, with that obtained by Tabatabai et al. (2005):2ηη + ξ(t)− 1 =t log µ(1 + t2)3/2(cid:18)log λ +√log µ1 + t2(cid:19)−2.2.2. The H1 diffusion processIn this section we will introduce a diffusion process associated with the curve(3). To this end, we will proceed with the general procedure of obtaining astochastic differential equation from an ordinary differential equation associatedwith the curve. We will then verify that the mean function of the resultingprocess is an H1 curve, which is useful for the purpose of making predictions insituations modeled by this type of growth.From (3) we can confirm that the curve verifies the differential equationwheredx(t)dt= h(t)x(t),x(t0) = x0,h(t) = −dξ(t)/dtη + ξ(t),4which is a generalization of the Malthusian growth model with a time-dependentfertility rate h(t).Replacing this fertility rate with h(t) + σ W (t), where W (t) denotes thestandard Wiener process and σ > 0, we obtain the Langevin equationdX(t)dt= h(t)X(t) + σ X(t) W (t),which, rewritten as a stochastic differential equation leads todX(t) = h(t)X(t)dt + σX(t)dW (t).(4)Taking into account that h is a continuous and bounded function, equation(4) verifies the conditions for the existence and uniqueness of solution (see Ok-sendal (2003)). The solution is a stochastic diffusion process taking values on R+and characterized by infinitesimal moments A1(x, t) = h(t)x and A2(x) = σ2x2.In addition, a closed-form expression for the solution can be provided. In fact,by considering the initial condition X(t0) = X0, independent from W (t) fort ≥ t0, we haveX(t) = X0η + ξ(t0)η + ξ(t)(cid:18)exp−σ22(t − t0) + σ(W (t) − W (t0)).(5)(cid:19)This process is a particular case of the lognormal diffusion process with ex-ogenous factors. Several applied works have been developed around this process.For instance, Guti´errez et al. (1999, 2003), performed an inferential analysis andassessed its usefulness for studies in Economics, including the consideration offirst-passage-time problems, a topic already considered in Guti´errez et al. (1995).As regards the distribution of the process, if X0 is distributed according to(cid:3) or X0 is a degenerate variable (P [X0 =a lognormal distribution Λ1x0] = 1), all the finite-dimensional distributions of the process are lognormal.Concretely, ∀n ∈ N and t1 < . . . < tn, vector (X(t1), . . . , X(tn))T has a n-dimensional lognormal distribution Λn[δ, Σ], where the components of vector δand matrix Σ are(cid:2)µ0; σ20δi = µ0 + log(cid:19)(cid:18) η + ξ(t0)η + ξ(t)−σ22(t − t0),i = 1, . . . , nandσij = σ20 + σ2(min(ti, tj) − t0),i, j = 1, . . . , nrespectively. The transition probability density function can be obtained fromthe distribution of (X(s), X(t))T , beingf (x, t|, y, s) =1x(cid:112)2πσ2(t − s)exp−(cid:16)5log xy − log η+ξ(s)η+ξ(t) + σ22σ2(t − s)2 (t − s)(cid:17)2that is, X(t)|X(s) = y follows a lognormal distributionX(t)|X(s) = y ⇝ Λ1(cid:18)log y + logη + ξ(s)η + ξ(t)−σ22(t − s); σ2(t − s)(cid:19).From the previous distributions the main characteristics of the process canbe found. If we noteGn(t|z, τ ) = zn(cid:19)n(cid:18) η + ξ(τ )η + ξ(t)exp(cid:18) n(n − 1)σ22(cid:19)(t − τ ), n ≥ 0,thenE [X(t)n] = Gn (t|E[X(t0)], t0)and E [X(t)n|X(τ ) = y] = Gn (t|y, τ ) .In particular, the mean function of the process and the one conditioned toan initial value x0 areandE [X(t)] = E[X(t0)]η + ξ(t0)η + ξ(t)E [X(t)|X(t0) = x0] = x0η + ξ(t0)η + ξ(t)respectively, which are H1 curves of the type (3) described previously. Thisjustifies considering the stochastic model herein proposed.3. Estimation of the modelLet us consider a discrete sampling of the process, based on d sample paths,for times tij, (i = 1, . . . , d, j = 1, . . . , ni) with ti1 = t1, i = 1, . . . , d. That is, weobserve variables X(tij), the values of which: x = {xij}i=1,...,d;j=1,...,ni, makeup the sample for the inferential study.By considering the most general case in which the initial distribution islognormal, X(t1) ∼ Λ(µ1, σ21), the log-likelihood function of the sample islog Lx(µ1, σ21, η, λ, µ, σ2) =d(cid:88)i=1log f1(xi1) +d(cid:88)ni(cid:88)i=1j=2log f (xij, tij|xi,j−1, ti,j−1)where f1 is the density function of X(t1).6Denoting N =d(cid:88)i=1ni, we havelog Lx(µ1, σ21, η, λ, µ, σ2) = −N2log(2π) −d2log σ21 −N − d2log σ2 −d(cid:88)i=1log xi1−−12σ2112σ2d(cid:88)i=1[log xi1 − µ1]2 −d(cid:88)ni(cid:88)i=1j=2log xij −12d(cid:88)ni(cid:88)i=1j=2log ∆ijd(cid:88)ni(cid:88)i=1j=2(cid:18)1∆ijRij − T η,λ,µij+(cid:19)2σ22∆ij(6)whereT η,λ,µij= log(cid:18) η + ξ(ti,j−1)η + ξ(tij)(cid:19), Rij = logxijxi,j−1and ∆ij = tij − ti,j−1.From (6) the ML estimates of µ1 and σ21 are(cid:98)µ1 =1dd(cid:88)i=1log xi1 and (cid:98)σ21 =1dd(cid:88)i=1(log xi1 − (cid:98)µ1)2.However, estimating the rest of the parameters poses some difficulties. Con-cretely, the resulting system of equations (see Appendix) is exceedingly complexand does not have an explicit solution. Therefore, numerical procedures mustbe employed to find its approximate solution. Since the likelihood system ofequations depends on sample data, it is impossible to carry out a general studyabout it. For instance, the conditions of convergence of the most widely usednumerical methods are impossible to verify. Such methods (as Newton-Raphsonand its variants) require calculating and inverting the Jacobian and Hessian ma-trices of the vectorial function that determines the system of equations. Thesample data may then lead to singular matrices and, consequently, to a failureof the numerical procedure. Rom´an et al (2012) contains an example of this(for a Gompertz-type diffusion process). Adding to this problem, we must alsoselect an initial solution.For these reasons, we propose the use of the local search metaheuristic fireflyalgorithm in order to maximize the likelihood function. The study and develop-ment of metaheuristic optimization algorithms have grown considerably in thelast years, with applications having been developed to several fields, includingestimations in diffusion processes. For example, Rom´an-Rom´an et al. (2012)used simulated annealing for estimating the parameters of a Gompertz-type dif-fusion process, whereas Rom´an-Rom´an and Torres-Ruiz (2015) suggested thevariable neighborhood search method in combination with simulated annealingin the context of the Richards diffusion process.Once we have found the estimates of µ1 and σ21, the problem becomes max-1, η, λ, µ, σ2). So, from (6), the target function weimizing function log Lx((cid:98)µ1, (cid:98)σ27will consider isfo(λ, µ, η, σ2) = −d(N − 1)2log σ2−12σ2d(cid:88)ni(cid:88)i=1j=2(cid:18)1∆ijRij − T η,λ,µij+(cid:19)2∆ij.σ223.1. Application of the firefly algorithmFA is a stochastic, population-based, and nature-inspired metaheuristic al-gorithm developed by Yang (2008). It has been successfully applied in manyfields such as optimization and engineering (see Kavousi-Fard et al. (2014);Niknam et al. (2012)) because of its efficiency and ability to deal with NP-hardproblems, becoming one of the most important tools of swarm intelligence, aresearch subfield of artificial intelligence focused on the collective behavior ofIn the last years many works havedecentralized and self-organized systems.explored in detail the theory of the firefly algorithm and its applications. See,for instance, Fister et al. (2013) and Yang and He (2013), as well as Fister et al.(2014) and Gandomi et al. (2013) where some modifications of the algorithmhave been introduced.The algorithm works over population subgroups, and thus it can deal effi-ciently with nonlinear and multimodal optimization problems. Indeed, FA canbe viewed as a generalization of well-known algorithms such as particle swarmoptimization (PSO), differential evolution, and simulated annealing (SA).It is inspired by the flashing lights of fireflies, produced by a bioluminescencephenomenon and used for attraction purposes between them. Thus, in basicterms, n fireflies are randomly distributed over the search space, with each ofthem having an associated light intensity that is dependent on its position.Then, at every generation, fireflies are attracted (attractiveness is proportionalto light intensity) by the brighter neighbors according to the distance betweenthem; that is, if a firefly flashes with high intensity, the closer ones will detecthigh attractiveness and fly towards it.With the movement of fireflies, the attraction between them is updated tothe new distances and light intensities, and the generation finishes by rankingthe fireflies from the dimmest to the brightest one, which correspond to thosethat provide a lowest and highest value of the objective function, respectively.This procedure is repeated for a fixed number of generations, with each onereducing the randomness of fireflies’ movements.Looking at the matter in more detail, it is obvious that light intensity, andtherefore attractiveness, varies according to the distance between fireflies andto the medium and its light-absorbing properties. The firefly algorithm usesthis characteristics in order to search for the local and global maxima of a givenfunction, defining the search space as the domain of the objective function andthe light intensity as proportional to the value of the function at every pointoccupied by a firefly. Therefore, measures of the attraction between fireflies mustdecrease when the distance and/or the absorption coefficient increase. Usually,this is formulated asβ(r) = β0 exp (cid:0)−γr2(cid:1) ,8where β0 is the attractiveness at r = 0 and γ is the absorption coefficient of themedium.Thus, if firefly i detects the greater light intensity of firefly j at distance rij,it results on a movement of i towards j according tok → xixik + β(rij)(cid:16)xjk − xik(cid:17)+ αϵk,(7)k and xjwhere xik are the k-th component of the position of the i-th and j-thfireflies, respectively, ϵk is a random value of the form u − 1/2 for u from anuniform distribution (it can be substituted by a Gaussian or other distribution),and α is the randomization parameter, which controls the stochastic influenceon the movement and is reduced recursively at every generation by a factorδ ∈ (0, 1) on form α → δα.It is noteworthy that FA is essentially managed by three parameters: ran-domization parameter (α), attractiveness (β0), and light absorption coefficient(γ). This can be displayed as an asymptotic behavior: for instance, if γ tendsto 0, the resulting constant attractiveness β = β0 leads to a special case of PSO,and when γ tends to ∞, FA becomes a random walk, parallel version of SA.Algorithm 1 Pseudocode of the firefly algorithmDefine objective function f (x) where x = (x1, . . . , xd)TAssign values for γ, β0, α, δ and M axGenerations (maximum number ofgenerations)Generate initial population of fireflies xi for i = 1, 2, . . . , nDetermine light intensity Ii at xi via f (xi)while t < M axGeneration dofor i = 1 : n all n fireflies dofor j = 1 : i all n fireflies doif Ii < Ij thenMove firefly i towards j according (7)end ifVary attractiveness with distance r via exp (cid:0)−γr2(cid:1)Update light intensity by evaluating new solutionsend forend forRank the fireflies (from lowest to highest value of the objective function)and find the current best (i.e., the last one).Update α by applying the reduction factor δend whilePostprocess results and visualization3.1.1. Initial parameters of the algorithm and bounding of the parametric spaceof the processAs regards the initial parameters of the algorithm, and following the com-ments of Yang (2008), the next considerations can be made:9• α: The randomization parameter controls randomness in the movement ofthe fireflies. It usually takes values between 0 and 1, with a value around0.2 being recommended.• δ: This parameter reduces α at every generation. Usually this value ischosen to be between 0.95 and 0.99.• β0: Since the attractiveness at distance r = 0 is usually considered to be1, β0 = 1 is taken in most cases.• γ: Absorption coefficient is a critical parameter that strongly influencesthe velocity of convergence. It simulates the environment conditions inwhich fireflies can detect light. In most cases, suitable values range from1 to 10.• n: The number of fireflies may vary in a wide range depending, for exam-ple, on the number of local maxima. Of course, having a high n ensures abetter coverage of the parametric space.• Generations: Usually a value between 50 and 100 is considered, althougha value below 50 can also provide good results.In any case, the high degree of efficiency of FA allows us to test it withdifferent initial values without incurring excessive computational costs.To determine the initial population of fireflies, n points of the parametricspace of the process must be randomly selected. To facilitate this choice, wepropose bounding such space. To this end, we will use the curve reformulationmade in section 2.1 and the information provided by the sample paths:• λ: It is between 0 and 1, in order to guarantee strictly increasing curves.• µ: It holds 0 < µ < λ−√1+t20 for a previously established λ.• η: This parameter can be bounded taking into account the asymptote ofthe curve verifying k = x0 (1 + ξ(t0)/η)). From that expression, and if wedenote by ki the maximum value of the i-th sample path, the followingexpression holds(cid:91)ξ(t0)(cid:20)maxi=1,...,d(cid:18) kixi0(cid:19)(cid:21)−1− 1< ˆη < (cid:91)ξ(t0)(cid:20)mini=1,...,d(cid:18) kixi0(cid:19)(cid:21)−1− 1,(8)where xi0 is the initial value of the i-th sample path. In practice, whent0 ̸= 0, the algorithm must choose values for λ and µ to finally constructan interval for η. Otherwise, in the case t0 = 0, the interval does notdepend on λ and µ.• σ: Regarding parameter σ, when it has high values it leads to sample pathswith great variability around the mean of the process. Thus, excessivevariability in available paths would make an H1-type modeling inadvisable.10Some simulations performed for several values of σ have led us to considerthat 0 < σ < 0.5, so that we may have paths compatible with an H1-typegrowth.4. Applications4.1. Application to simulated dataWe will now proceed to introduce some simulation studies. These will beaimed at validating the procedures described above as they apply to estimatingthe parameters of the process.The general pattern of simulations is based on generating 30 sample paths ofthe H1 diffusion process in interval [0, 50] from (5). All sample paths have thesame length, and ti = (i − 1) · 0.1, i = 1, . . . , 501 are the time instants at whichobservations are made. Each example has been replicated 50 times, that is, foreach combination of the parameters of the model that we have considered, thesimulation of the trajectories and the estimation procedure has been carried out50 times. The final results are the average of those obtained in each replication.A first simulation example has been performed by taking a degenerate initialstate at x0 = 0.1 and parameters η = 0.5, λ = 0.8, µ = 0.8 and σ = 0.015 forthe process. Figure 1 shows the simulated paths.Figure 1: Some simulated sample paths of the H1-type diffusion process.We have considered n = 40 fireflies, that is 40 4-uples of the parametricspace, and selected each one as follows: firstly, for λ, we choose a random value(uniformly distributed) between 0 and 1 and then, for µ, we take a random valuein the interval (0, 1/λ) since t0 = 0 in this case. The 4-uple is completed byselecting a random value for η in the interval (0.3562706, 0.5612756) (by virtueof (8)) and for σ in the interval (0, 0.5).As regards the parameters for FA, we have made the following choices:• 80 generations.11010203040500.100.150.200.250.300.35• α = 0.2.• δ = 0.97.• β0 = 1.• γ = 1.λ0.8Real valueEstimated value0.7873909Abs. relative error 0.0157614µ0.80.81845370.0230670η0.50.50015650.0003129σ0.0150.01495640.0029034fo55554.1755554.580.0000073Table 1: Results of the firefly algorithm over simulated data.Table 1 contains the real and estimated values of the parameters, as wellas the value of the objective function f0 at the resulting point. As a measureof the estimation error we have also included the absolute relative error, i.e.,the difference in absolute value between real and estimated value, divided bythe real one. From here we can observe very good results in terms of estimatedvalues and absolute relative errors.The behavior of the algorithm over generations is shown with more detail inFigures 2 and 3. For each parameter of the process, that is, for each coordinateof the fireflies, each line of Figure 2 represents a generation (from lighter grayto dark black) showing the estimated values of the parameter for each firefly.Figure 3 shows, for each parameter of the process, the evolution of its estimatedvalue for each firefly over the last 60 generations. Green and red lines representthe evolution of the estimation provided by the best and the worst firefly ineach generation, respectively. Remember that the best firefly is the one thatprovides the highest value of the objective function, whereas the worst producesthe smaller one.Since the parametric space is 4-dimensional, it is impossible to visualize theevolution of the fireflies. For this reason, in Figure 4 we have included graphs ofthe dynamics of the best firefly in each generation, for each pair of parameters.Figure 5 shows the evolution of the objective function f0 for the best fireflyin each generation. Obviously this graph is increasing since the best fireflyof each generation improves the value of the objective function of the best ofthe previous generation. Finally, Figure 6 shows the real and estimated meanfunction of the H1 diffusion process.12Figure 2: First simulation example: evolution (from light gray to black) of 80 generations of40 fireflies for η = 0.5, λ = 0.8, µ = 0.8 and σ = 0.015 (left to right, top to bottom).

Over this data let us apply FA, varyingparameters α, γ, δ and the number of fireflies n, and considering 60 generations.The efficiency of the algorithm allows this type of studies to be carried outwithout incurring in an excessive computational cost. For example, for thissimulation study, with 40 fireflies and 60 generations, the computation timehas been 6 seconds for each replication, that is, 5 minutes for the total 50replications.Next, we analyze the behavior of absolute errors related to each pair ofparameters considered when applying FA. These errors have been calculated byaveraging over all other parameters.Table 2 shows such errors by varying α and γ.It can be seen that, ingeneral, the error increases when γ grows, regardless of the α value, with themost appropriate γ values being those between 1 and 5. Conversely, for eachγ, biggest errors are associated with extreme values of α, being 0.2 and 0.4 thevalues for which the observed errors are smaller.51α0.1 0.0199 0.03110.0089 0.00950.20.0073 0.00480.40.0125 0.01150.60.0112 0.01600.80.0126 0.02090.9γ100.02950.01230.01110.01420.02740.0306200.05020.02200.02700.02980.04790.0459350.04540.03950.03940.04950.06420.0548Table 2: Second simulation example: absolute relative error of ˆfo for α vs. γ.15010203040500.100.150.200.250.30Table 3 compares absolute relative errors as a function of α and δ. These twoparameters are related since they mark the level of randomness with which thefireflies move in the space. A priori, it seems logical to think that when setting asmall α value (low randomness), it should decrease slowly in later stages, whichis associated with higher δ values. The situation should be reversed as a largerα initial value is selected, in which case a smaller δ value should be selected.This intuition is confirmed after observing this table. Specifically, the optimalcombination is given by α = 0.2 (as suggested by Yang (2008)) and δ = 0.99.0.9α0.10.03310.2 0.01670.4 0.01150.6 0.01090.8 0.01350.9 0.0099δ0.950.00900.00750.01140.01510.03370.03510.970.00520.00470.01140.01660.04260.04610.990.00790.00430.02540.04420.07480.0767Table 3: Second simulation example: absolute relative error of ˆfo for α vs. δ.Table 4 considers δ and γ parameters. It can be seen how, in general, forfixed γ errors grow as δ increases.

In all cases, it is observed how the error always decreases(as seems logical) with n, regardless of the other parameter considered.On the other hand, regardless of n, the smallest errors are associated withthe central values of α, specifically for α = 0.2, 0.4, as can be observed in Table5. For fixed n, Table 6 shows that the preferable γ values are those between 1and 10, with γ = 1 being the most recommendable. Finally, Table 7 does notshow large differences in error when δ varies.4.2.

This is a method used in molecular biology to amplify DNA or RNApieces (nucleic acids) by taking advantage of the polymerase enzyme.Different qPCR techniques allow the simultaneous amplification and quan-tification of the obtained product. In particular, kinetic PCR can quantify theproduct from the cycle at which certain threshold of amplicon DNA is reached(the exponential phase).In order to calculate this cycle, this technique (aswell as other methods) employ fluorescence monitoring, and consider the firstcycle that exceeds a certain level of fluorescence. Rutledge and Cote (2003)established the criteria for the mathematical development of kPCR technique,focusing on the threshold of log-fluorescence. Absolute quantification is achievedusing a standard curve constructed by amplification of known amounts of targetDNA and plotting the values obtained for the threshold cycle, Ct, against targetDNA concentration.As can be seen, the determination of the Ct cycle is vital for this technique.Since we are dealing with a dynamic phenomenon, we consider fitting an H1-typediffusion process in order to model, at each instant of time (cycle in this case),the level of fluorescence. Please note that when considering a stochastic process,at each time instant we have a random variable that models the behavior ofthe variable under study, which allows us to take into account the randomfluctuations that exist in this type of phenomena. In addition, it is possible tointroduce the use of techniques associated with the study of temporal variablessuch as first-passage times, that is, the time at which the process verifies, forthe first time, a certain property.The data (available as supplementary material in the paper mentioned above)corresponds to fluorescence emitted for several replicate amplifications (con-cretely 20) in a given concentration of DNA (as a matter of fact, in the paperthe authors considered six magnitudes of target concentration, the first of whichis being considered in our study) over 45 cycles (Figure 7). We have to notethat, given the characteristics of the process introduced, the values consideredin our study are those of fluorescence, and not its logarithm.18Figure 7: Real application: Fluorescence versus cycleIn order to apply FA to estimating the parameters of the process, we haveconsidered, for the initial parameters of the algorithm, a combination of valuessuggested from the simulation study previously performed. Concretely, α =0.2, 0.4, γ = 1, 5, δ = 0.90.95, 0.97, 0.99. In addition, we have considered n = 20fireflies over 110 generations. The initial time instant for the observed values ist1 = 0, whereas for the initial value we have considered the mean of the initialvalues of the sample paths, being x1 = 0.000125.The results are summarized in Table 8. For each combination of the initialvalues of the algorithm we have calculated the absolute relative errors betweenthe observed data of the fluorescence and the corresponding estimate from themean function of the estimated process, once the parameters of the process havebeen estimated. From this table we conclude that the optimal combination ofthe initial parameters for FA are α = 0.2, γ = 1 and δ = 0.99.190102030400.00.10.20.30.40.5CycleFluorescenceα0.2γ150.415δ0.90.950.970.990.90.950.970.990.90.950.970.990.90.950.970.99ˆη0.000310.000290.000300.000300.000300.000290.000300.000320.000320.000290.000340.000320.000280.000290.000280.00031ˆλ0.468690.468470.462740.445800.449960.460620.475820.431980.469430.442800.442290.451370.484610.427970.465800.45165ˆµ1.896611.885741.947782.279412.052631.935211.803972.457401.889932.269972.334652.211211.664312.536491.864362.17721ˆσ0.024990.025000.025000.025000.025000.025000.025000.024990.025000.024990.024990.025000.024890.025000.025000.02500Error0.225490.220920.232960.174870.265640.265070.227220.206230.233090.220140.220910.192020.295210.189410.298210.19100Table 8: Estimated parameter values and absolute relative errors from the application of FAto real data.From these values, we have estimated the model again by increasing thenumber of fireflies, following the conclusions obtained in the second simulationstudy.

Even when the simulated process differs from the original in thefirsts cycles, the important question is whether we can find the cycles at whichthe fluorescence threshold is reached (see Figure 10, showing log-fluorescencevalues for the original data and the logarithm of the simulated sample paths ofthe estimated process. The horizontal line represents a fluorescence threshold).This issue can be approached using techniques associated with the study oftemporal variables in the context of diffusion processes, as in the case of first-passage times.Figure 10: Real application:simulated sample paths of the simulated process (red).log-fluorescence for original data (grey) and logarithm of the5. ConclusionsThe hyperbolastic type I diffusion process is obtained, showing to be advan-tageous over the deterministic hyperbolastic type-I curve, of wide use in manyresearch fields. This diffusion process allows us to introduce into the model allthe information coming from data, as well as the random factors which mustbe taken into account in order to explain different growth phenomena. Nev-ertheless, improvements resulting from the use of this curve are dependent onthe number of parameters to estimate, and even though in this work we havereduced this quantity in one element, this complicates the development of theinference procedure. Computationally efficient methods are therefore necessary,among which metaheuristic algorithms, such as the firefly algorithm, are ableto reduce computational cost.In this work we have developed the theoretical base for the practical use ofhyperbolastic type-I diffusion processes as a particular case of the lognormalprocess with exogenous factors, and applying the firefly algorithm in order tosolve inference problems.22010203040−4−3−2−1CycleLog FluorescenceSimulations were performed, which show that the strategy used for bound-ing the parametric space behaves well, as does the firefly algorithm for differentchoices of its parameters. From the simulations we have obtained several combi-nations of the parameters of the algorithm that can be considered optimal. Anexample based on real data from a study about quantitative polymerase chainreaction is also developed, showing the capability of the process for fitting thefluorescence levels associated with the amplification of amplicons of DNA.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported in part by the Ministerio de Econom´ıa y Compet-itividad, Spain, under grant MTM2014-58061-P.6.
